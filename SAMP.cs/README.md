# SAMP.cs

SAMP.cs is a library that can be used to write SA:MP scripts in C#. [SAMP.dev](https://github.com/enginestein/SAMP.dev) follows a different architecture to write SA:MP scripts based on a .dll file written in C but SAMP.cs can be called a rewrite of SA:MP in C#.

# Installation

You can install SAMP.cs from nuget:

```bash
nuget install sampcs
```

# Usage

```C#
using System;

namespace SAMPCS
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            SAMPCS.SampApi.AddMessageToChat("{FFFFFF}SAMP {FF0000}CS {00FF00}sample");

            SAMPCS.SampApi.AddMessageToChat(
                $"You are in {SAMPCS.SampApi.GetPlayerCurrentZone()} with angle {SAMPCS.SampApi.GetPlayerFacingAngle():F1}");

            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
